# Saturation Analysis for Interview Study (Minimizing Threats Through Responsible Voluntary Confidential Food Safety Data Sharing: Insights from Food Industry Leaders)

This repository contains code used to conduct a saturation analysis for a qualitative interview study. The analysis includes:
- A sequential saturation curve
- A comparison of code emergence in actual vs. randomized interview order
- A bootstrap analysis to assess impact of interview order on ssaturation points

## Overview

The goal of this analysis was to evaluate when code saturation was reached in the data (27 interview transcripts). This helped us detemine
the adequency of our sample size.

## Files

- 'saturation_analysis.ipynb' - Main notebook contaning the full code used in the analysis
- 'S3. Binary_coded_matrix_data' - Input data

## Requirements

This code was developed in Google Colab (https.//colab.research.google.com), which comes pre-installed with necessary packages, including:
- NumPy
- pandas
- matplotlib
To use Google Colab, you will need a Google account to open, run, and save notebooks.
To run this code locally, make sure you have the above packages installed
